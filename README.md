#Adding Audio Button

The purpose of this project is to create a sticky audio element attached to an existing project of mine. And the project I chose is the integrated project from my second term at school. 

It is a Lord of the Ring themed website to celebrate the 15th anniversary for the first movie. Everything on this webpage is made from scratch, including all the imageries and videos.

Despite the immaturity of the page, I chose it to work on for the reason below:

* It is long enough to show the sticky function
* There is no additional dependencies installation needed for it to run

Thanks!
